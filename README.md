# Medal Prediction Using Regression

This project focuses on predicting the number of medals a team would win in a specific year using a regression model. The model was trained on a dataset of teams with historical performance data.

I compared the predicted values with the actual results to evaluate performance. The workflow included standard preprocessing steps like data cleaning, feature selection, and normalization, followed by model training and testing.

Basic evaluation metrics were used to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the predictions.
